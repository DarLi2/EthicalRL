EthicalRL

This project provides scripts to train RL-agents in scenarios where there exists a moral dimension to their decision problem. 

Run "make requirements" to set up the project. 
To change the environment, you want the agent to be trained on, go to the .json file in train_setup.
To select the model and the hyperparameters, go to the corresponding .json file in train_setup. 
To display and delete trained models, tun "manage_agents.py".
